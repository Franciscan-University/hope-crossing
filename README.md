## Playing the Game
The Game will begin as soon as it is opened in the browser. There is a modal that explains the basic movements. Try to make it across to the water as many times as possible to reach new scores. Collect rosary rings along the way to gain bonus points.
As you get further into scores, the game will get more difficult.
